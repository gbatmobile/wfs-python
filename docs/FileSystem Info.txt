Restoration of video surveillance system that uses WFS0.4

Cheap CCTV systems were widely spread. As data storage systems use one or more of hard disk drives for recording video streams from multiple cameras. Organization of space in these devices is very specific. There you will not see the classic file systems that are used to seeing in a home PC (FAT32, ExFAT, NTFS, Ext 2, Ext 3, Ext 4, XFS, and the like) Disc WFS0.4 in LBA 0 contains a marker file system as its name at offset 0x0 and a marker at offset 58h 4Dh 0x1FE (instead of the usual 55h AAh). Various versions of OS Windows, Linux is considered the disc does not contain any information, therefore, you should not try to see the contents of the disk by the functionality of these operating systems.

LBA 0 WFS0.4 file system

LBA 0 filesystem WFS0.4

This file system is no file names. There is a region, for example 0x17e00 (LBA 191), which descriptions are fragments of video streams to a description given to each piece of 32 bytes, which is described, that is located in the block 2 megabytes. The record has two timestamp (timestamp) of 4 bytes (in a particular format), which contain a start and end time of recording. The record contains a link to another record number, if recording a video dvuhmegabaytnogo block was not enough. In the description of the blocks, which act as the continuation of recording video time stamp indicated for a fragment of the movie that they contain. In the initial recording time stamp shows the entire time interval of full video, which consists of several blocks. Also in the record contains information about the number of cameras.

Description index entry
Offset Length (bytes) Description
0x1 Byte 1 byte attributes. There are the following values: 0x1 - block is a continuation of the video, 0x2 - block is the beginning of the video, 0xFE - reserved or distant recording
0x2 2 bytes, depending on the status byte displays the attributes, or the number of fragments following the start of the recording, or track number.
0x4 4 byte pointer to the number of the previous track record. Please note that the block numbers can not serve all the values ??from the set 0x0 - 0xFF
0h8 4 byte pointer to the number of the next track. If fragmentation is not, then 0. Please note that the block numbers can not serve all the values ??from the set 0x0 - 0xFF
0xC 4 bytes The timestamp to start recording video.
0x10 4 bytes mark the end of the video recording.
0x18 4 bytes Number of the first portion of the video.
0x1E 1 Byte Number camera
 

Index writes WFS file system

Index recording file system WFS0.4

In the above example, the origin point of the data area 0x8F60000 (LBA 293 632). From this point begins space for video streams. If you have the correct information in the description of the fragments (in index entries) to copy the files of video streams, by the cameras will not be difficult. There are software tools from the manufacturers of DVRs, allowing you to view and copy videos by connecting the drive to your PC. In case of damage to the field or to index the records of the operation to delete records, disc initialization or formatting task is much more complicated.

Video Stream Data h264

The sample data of the video stream

Since no other metadata from this file system is not present, then the data in such cases it is possible to restore a method of analysis of regular expressions. The fragments of the video is no information about the room camera. The video stream from these registers consists of the video clips, starting with a regular expression 0x00 0x00 0x01 0xFC 0x02 0x0C 0x74 0x48 followed by the four byte time stamp of the fragment. Each video segment that belongs to this video will go in series with monotonic increase in the time stamp. As part dvuhmegabaytnogo block you want to search all the regular expression to check whether the record has ended in this block. If the record is not complete, it is necessary to search for a regular expression at the beginning of the next block adjacent streams and analyze them to determine the time stamp unit, which is a continuation of the record. After recording in the rest of the block are written zeros. On this basis it is not difficult to determine the end of the recording.

Particular attention in this case deserves timestamp. The time stamp is composed of 4 bytes. This mark expresses the count in specific units from 0 hours 0 minutes of January 1, 2000. Junior (zero) bytes can hold values ??from 0 to 239 (ie, describe the four-minute interval), and this is not a value from 0x0 to 0xEF. In the set of numbers from 0x0 to 0xFF are exceptions. The unit price in this byte is equal to one second. The first byte may also contain a value from 0 to 239, and this is again not from 0x0 to 0xEF. The unit price of this byte 4 minutes. In the second byte of an even narrower range of values. The unit price in this byte is 16 hours. The high byte is similar, not all values ??in the set of 0x0 to 0xFF. The unit price of the last byte is equal to four months.

After clarification of the structural features of the timestamp becomes possible to search for movies and the establishment of the shooting date. Determine the number of cameras can be graphic signs in the video (if the corresponding option has been included in the DVR).
