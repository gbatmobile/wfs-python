#[wfs-python] 

This is a tool for recover videos from a WFS0.4/5. WFS is a file system popular in chinese DVRs and we dont know any tools public available to extract videos from this file system.

This software should be used with care; I and a partner have decoded the filesystem from scratch and, of course, error are problable. In spite, we have succefully tested this implementation in a dozen of images acquired in several contexts.

We have also implemented a The Sleuth Toolkit (TSK) recover for WFS (see https://github.com/gbatmobile/sleuthkit4.9.0-wfs). It is more complicated to use, but much more flexible.
Anyway, if you just to want export videos using a GUI, this is your tool.
